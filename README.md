## Monetization

Right now, I just put in a 1% fee for the payment hardcoded into the app. I feel bad about this though because a lot of the credit should go to the original author of the axie-scholar-utilities. So if you have a better idea of how to monetize, feel free to open a PR or shoot me a message (find me by going to my [linkchain](https://linkchain.me/michael))
